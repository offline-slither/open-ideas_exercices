how does it work ?


page_output = True/False enable or disabel output printing file with the data 

there is an hardcoded pre-made list in the main file and and exterior file 
to generate a srtore from the file use 
 
marketmaker()

to genereate one from your file use

fromlist_marketmaker()

none take input but in another version you'll be able to input a filename in fromlist_marketmaker()
